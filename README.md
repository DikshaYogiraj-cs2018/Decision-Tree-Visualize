 I am happy to share that I have successfully completed the #task6 of My Data Science and Business Analytics Internship for 
  Graduate Rotational Internship Program offered by The Sparks Foundation.<br/>

Task 6:  Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. <br/>

The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to 
predict the right class accordingly.  

<br/>tools and technologies: Python and Juypter Notebook
